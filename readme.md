## Description

This project refers to the automation of a wheelchair. In this repository, you can find the software written in C uploaded to the microcontroller (PIC16F877A) for reading the inputs and sending a signal to motor drivers.

### History

* This project started in 2012 as the final project of the technical/professional course in Industrial Automation (group of 5 students). We adapted the mechanical part of a regular wheelchair and added motors, control electronics and batteries. The wheelchair could be controled using a joystick or the head inclination measured with an accelerometer.
* In 2014, voice recognition features were added using a voice recognition module with pre recorded voice patterns, as a project for the undergraduate course "Transducers lab".
